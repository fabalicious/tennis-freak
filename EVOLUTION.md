# Tennis ATP Ranking Visualization - Evolution Log

## 2025-09-15 - Advanced Chart Features & UI Improvements
**Commit**: [c85ffdf](https://github.com/fabalicious/tennis-freak/commit/c85ffdf) - Add Y-axis toggle and redesign legend

### ðŸ”„ Y-Axis Toggle Functionality
- **Dual View Modes**: Added toggle between Rankings view and Points view
  - Rankings mode: Traditional 1-10 ranking positions (lower is better)
  - Points mode: ATP points scale with proportional spacing
  - Smart scaling keeps 1st and 10th place players fixed in position
- **Dynamic Interface**: Toggle button with active state styling
- **Conditional Rendering**: Chart title, axis labels, and formatting adapt to mode
- **Real-time Updates**: Smooth transitions when switching between views

### ðŸŽ¨ Professional Legend Redesign
- **Left-Side Positioning**: Moved legend from right to left side of chart
- **Ranking Format**: Shows actual rankings (1., 2., 3., etc.) with bigger fonts
- **Color Coordination**: Each player has colored dot matching their line color
- **Current Data Display**: Shows latest ATP points for each player
- **Vertical Spacing**: Legend spans full chart height for better visual balance

### ðŸ“‹ Project Organization
- **TODO.md**: Created structured task tracking system
- **Progress Tracking**: Systematic approach to feature implementation
- **Documentation**: Clear roadmap for future enhancements

### ðŸ”§ Technical Enhancements
- **Reactive Chart Updates**: Chart redraws automatically on toggle changes
- **Smart Data Filtering**: Legend shows only top 10 ranked players with latest data
- **Improved Margins**: Optimized chart spacing for new legend layout
- **Professional Styling**: Enhanced typography and visual hierarchy

### âœ… Completed Features
1. âœ… Y-axis toggle between rankings and points
2. âœ… Left-side ranking legend with color dots
3. âœ… Current points display in legend
4. âœ… Professional UI styling and layout
