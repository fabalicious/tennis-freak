## 2024-09-14 - Initial Setup & Complete Implementation

### ðŸš€ Project Foundation
- **Backend Setup**: FastAPI server with SQLite database
  - Realistic ATP ranking data for 15 top players (Djokovic, Alcaraz, Medvedev, etc.)
  - Weekly rankings for the past year with point fluctuations
  - REST API endpoints for players, rankings by date, date ranges, and player history
  - CORS configuration for frontend integration

- **Database Schema**:
  - `players` table: id, name, country
  - `rankings` table: date, player_id, ranking, points
  - Realistic initial point distribution (9800 for #1, declining appropriately)
  - Weekly point fluctuations (Â±100-400) to simulate tournament results

### ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Implementation
- **SvelteKit + D3.js**: Interactive visualization framework
  - TypeScript support with proper type definitions
  - Responsive design with mobile optimization
  - Component-based architecture

  - `TennisChart.svelte`: D3.js line chart with interactive features
  - `api.ts`: TypeScript API service layer with proper error handling
  - Main page with time period controls and statistics

### ðŸ“Š Visualization Features
